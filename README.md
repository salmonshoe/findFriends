# Objective
To build a compatibility-based 'Friend Finder' web application that works like a dating app. It will take results from user surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Challenges
The strugglle I face with this project is alerting users of their best match from the JSON friends file after posting the survey inputs. The approach I plan to take is to loop through each friend object and compare the results to the recently submitted results.
  What adds to this challenge is the integers I have set originally for the website compared to inputs of scores printing out as strings. That must be solved before I attempt to troubleshoot the main hurdle I face to complete this web application.
