# Objective
To build a compatibility-based 'Friend Finder' web application that works like a dating app. It will take results from user surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Challenges
I still have yet to complete the functionality to create matches for users and provide an alert once the logic has went through the data to find who they are compatible with.
